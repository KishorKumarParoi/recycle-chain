# Recycle Chain

Recycle Chain is a smart-contract based application that tracks waste and ensures it is recycled. The project consists of a Next.js frontend, a NestJS backend, and a React Native mobile application for Android and iOS.

## Project Structure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Yarn
- Docker (for running the blockchain locally)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kishorkumarparoi/recycle-chain.git
cd recycle-chain
```

Project Setup
Backend (NestJS)
The backend is built using NestJS and provides APIs for tracking waste and ensuring it is recycled. The backend interacts with the smart contract deployed on the blockchain.

Frontend (Next.js)
The frontend is built using Next.js and provides a web interface for users to track waste and ensure it is recycled. The frontend interacts with the backend APIs.

Mobile Application (React Native)
The mobile application is built using React Native and provides a mobile interface for users to track waste and ensure it is recycled. The mobile app interacts with the backend APIs.

Smart Contracts
The smart contracts are deployed on a local blockchain and are used to track waste and ensure it is recycled. The smart contracts are written in Solidity and deployed using Truffle.
